I tested the program in Visual Studio. All work is done in the command line; there is no visual interface. 
The program creates the files itself, all data is stored in txt files and can be edited externally. 
To start with, I recommend creating several players (Command 1. Create new chess player) and then viewing the general table (2. Display all players). 
The tournament is created using command 3. ‘Select players by surname’. 
Command 4. Simulate single round forms one pair between two players. 
Command 5. is not working yet, but there are plans to refine the function that creates a file with the top record holders by rating (1500, 1600, etc.). 
Command 6. (Exit) - exits the program, saving all changes.
